# survey-form-00016474


This application was developed for Web Application module, as coursework portfolio project @ WIUT by student ID: 00016474.

### Project Topic:
To determine the topic for my web application, I divided my student ID (16474) by 20, which resulted in a remainder of 14. Therefore, I am working on **Survey Form** (Topic 14).

### Project Topic:
This application allows users to create, update, delete responses. 
Surveys are displayed in the page. Demonstration of all CRUD operations are done with responses because:
1. it is mainly for users, for answering
2. survey would follow the same logic
